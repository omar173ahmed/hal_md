Personal relationship management of your ego social network using plain-text Markdown files. Think of it like a Personal CRM on steroids.

At this point, mostly a collection of templates but over tine could evolved. Relies heavily on a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) like tool but also

## Context

Getting here has been a decades-long journey which you can read about in [The Long and Winding Road](docs/journey.md).

## Navigating your social network

You can use any text editor but preferably one that supports wikilinks, YAML frontmatter, and queries.

1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) by fellow Canadians [Erica Xu](https://github.com/ericaxu) and [Shida Li](https://github.com/lishid)
2. [Silver Bullet](https://github.com/silverbulletmd) which is Open-Source by Polish [Zef Hemel](https://github.com/zefhemel)

Obsidian has a graph view (aka Map of Content aka MoC) which is fun to visualize your social network. Visual Studio Code is handy as well.

## Helper tools

I've written some Python tools to convert exports from various messaging apps to Markdown. So far, I've done LinkedIn ([linkedin_md](https://github.com/thephm/linkedin_md)), Signal ([signal_md](https://github.com/thephm/signal_md)), and SMS Backup ([sms_backup_md](https://github.com/thephm/sms_backup_md)). Why? So I can get **my** conversations with people in **my** network into **my** own files that **I** can control and use directly with **my** social network data. Each of those tools rely on [message_md](https://github.com/thephm/message_md).

## How it works

There is no real software (yet?), mostly Obsidian templates and some instructions.

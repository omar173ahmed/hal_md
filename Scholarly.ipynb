            "Year: 2017\n",
            "Abstract: This study advances a conceptual framework to examine how students who had transferred into a four-year institution described their transition experiences.

            "Abstract: We define a mathematical formalism based on the concept of an ‘‘open dynamical system” and show how it can be used to model embodied cognition. This formalism extends classical dynamical systems theory by distinguishing a ‘‘total system’’ (which models an agent in an environment) and an ‘‘agent system’’ (which models an agent by itself), and it includes tools for analyzing the collections of overlapping paths that occur in an embedded agent's state space. To illustrate the way this formalism can be applied, several neural network models are embedded in a simple model environment. Such phenomena as masking, perceptual ambiguity, and priming are then observed. We also use this formalism to reinterpret examples from the embodiment literature, arguing that it provides for a more thorough analysis of the relevant phenomena.\n",

I first became interested in Husserl around 1991, when I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, attending Hubert Dreyfus’ well-known lectures on Heidegger. Dreyfus would pace back and forth after a student’s question, genuinely thinking about it, sometimes saying things like “Well, maybe you’re right, and I’ve been wrong all these years.” I took full advantage of Dreyfus’ open attitude toward discussion, pressing my doubts about Heidegger in office hours. Dreyfus would patiently entertain my questions, identify errors in my reasoning, and think through the issues on their own terms. At one point he said,“you sound like a Husserlian.” It turned out he was right. I went on to study Husserl with David Woodruff Smith at UC Irvine, who introduced me to Husserl’s texts, and to a formal, analytic way of reading them.

On Gurwitsch’s account, as we develop it, the field of consciousness has a variable sized focus or “theme” of attention surrounded by a structured periphery of inattentional contents. As the field evolves, its contents change their status, sometimes smoothly, sometimes abruptly. Inner thoughts, a sense of one’s body, and the physical environment are dominant field contents. These ideas can be linked with (and help unify) contemporary theories about the neural correlates of consciousness, inattention, the small world structure of the brain, meta-stable dynamics, embodied cognition, and predictive coding in the brain.\n",

To address the issue, I show how supervenience relations give rise to ‘supervenience functions’, and use these functions to show how dynamical systems at different levels are related to one another.

            "Abstract: Traditionally different approaches to the study of cognition have been viewed as competing explanatory frameworks. An alternative view, explanatory pluralism, regards different approaches to the study of cognition as complementary ways of studying the same phenomenon, at specific temporal and spatial scales, using appropriate methodological tools. Explanatory pluralism has been often described abstractly, but has rarely been applied to concrete cases. We present a case study of explanatory pluralism. We discuss three separate ways of studying the same phenomenon: a perceptual decision-making task , where pairs of subjects share information to jointly individuate an oddball stimulus among a set of distractors. Each approach analyzed the same corpus but targeted different units of analysis at different levels of description: decision-making at the behavioral level, confidence sharing at the linguistic level, and acoustic energy at the physical level. We discuss the utility of explanatory pluralism for describing this complex, multiscale phenomenon, show ways in which this case study sheds new light on the concept of pluralism, and highlight good practices to critically assess and complement approaches.\n",

I use this account to defend Husserl against several forms of Heideggerean critique. One line of critique, recently elaborated by Taylor Carman, says that Husserl wrongly loads everyday perception with explicit beliefs about things. A second, earlier line of critique, due to Hubert Dreyfus, charges Husserl with thinking of belief on a problematic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model which involves explicit rules applied to discrete symbol structures.

Recently, however, cognitive scientists and philosophers studying \"embodied\" or \"situated\" cognition have begun emphasizing the role of the body and environment in which brains are situated, i.e. they view the brain as an \"open system\". However, these theorists frequently rely on dynamical systems which are traditionally viewed as closed systems. We address this tension by extending the framework of dynamical systems theory. We show how structures which appear in the state space of an embodied agent differ from those that appear in closed systems, and we show how these structures can be used to model representational processes in embodied agents. We focus on neural networks as models of embodied cognition.\n",

            "Abstract: Embodied approaches to cognition see abstract thought and language as grounded in interactions between mind, body, and world. A particularly important challenge for embodied approaches to cognition is mathematics, perhaps the most abstract domain of human knowledge. Conceptual metaphor theory, a branch of cognitive linguistics, describes how abstract mathematical concepts are grounded in concrete physical representations. In this paper, we consider the implications of this research for the metaphysics and epistemology of mathematics. In the case of metaphysics, we argue that embodied mathematics is neutral in the sense of being compatible with all existing accounts of what mathematical entities really are. However, embodied mathematics may be able to revive an older position known as psychologism and overcome the difficulties it faces. In the case of epistemology, we argue that the evidence collected in the embodied mathematics literature is inconclusive: It does not show that abstract mathematical thinking is constituted by metaphor; it may simply show that abstract thinking is facilitated by metaphor. Our arguments suggest that closer interaction between the philosophy and cognitive science of mathematics could yield a more precise, empirically informed account of what mathematics is and how we come to have knowledge of it.\n",

I show that most varieties of supervenience are either determination relations or determination relations conjoined with dependence relations. In the process of unpacking these connections I identify limitations of existing concepts of supervenience and provide ways of overcoming them. What results is a more precise, flexible, and powerful set of tools for relating sets of properties than current concepts of supervenience provide.

The concept of resonance has played an important role in ecological psychology, but it remains a metaphor. Supplying a mechanistic account of resonance requires a non-representational account of central nervous system (CNS) dynamics. Towards this, we present a series of simple models in which a reservoir network with homeostatic nodes is used to control a simple agent embedded in an environment. This network spontaneously produces behaviors that are adaptive in each context, including (1) visually tracking a moving object, (2) substantially above-chance performance in the arcade …\n",

There seems to be an unbridgeable “explanatory gap” between the two. Whereas other scientific explanations (eg the explanation of temperature in terms of kinetic energy) involve determinate relationships between two kinds of phenomena, correlations between patterns of neural activity and conscious experiences seem to be arbitrary. I argue that by developing computer models of embodied agents, and interpreting them using the tools of philosophical phenomenology, the relationship between neural and conscious processes can be seen to be systematic, and non-arbitrary. Visualizations of these models serve as “bridge metaphors” that further emphasize how systematic neuro-phenomenological relations are. By showing that links between brain states and conscious states are non-arbitrary, the explanatory gap is narrowed.\n",

Levinas' mature work on the ethical dimensions of experience stems from his critical engagement with Husserl's phenomenological analyses of empathy and intersubjectivity, and develops an account that emphasizes the experience of looking at another conscious being in the face. Based on these and other observations, Thomasson concludes that \"the very idea of analytic philosophy and its proper role\" and \"some of its characteristic methods\" owe more to phenomenology than is generally acknowledged.

For example, it is not clear how extensive it is.

It is associated with several philosophical movements, including existentialism, post-structuralism, and Continental philosophy broadly, which emphasize human subjectivity, agency, and meaning; embeddedness in historical and social structures; and alternatives to scientific reasoning as a basic mode of access to knowledge. Phenomenology is often thought of as being organized around specific philosophers (eg, Husserlian phenomenology, Heideggerian phenomenology, and Merleau-Pontyan phenomenology), or into regional or linguistic groups (French phenomenology, German phenomenology, Anglo-American phenomenology). It can also be organized by topic (phenomenology and race, embodiment, art, cognitive science, etc.). Some of these groupings can be further subdivided: for example, Husserlian phenomenology in America is sometimes divided into “West Coast” and “East Coast” schools of interpretation (Yoshimi et al., 2019) and several schools of Heideggerian and Merleau-Pontian phenomenology can be distinguished (Muller, Chapter “The Landscape of Merleau-Pontyan Thought” and Zangeneh, Chapter “Heideggerian Phenomenology”, this volume; also see Sheehan, 2001). It is not clear to what extent these divisions are reflected in the organization of work done within the field, as expressed by patterns of communication between authors. To assess this, we analyze the phenomenology literature using bibliometric methods (Osareh, 1996 …\n",

In that period I got to know Dallas Willard and his students, who were like-minded: they also read Husserl as a realist, and were also interested in links between Husserl and analytic philosophy. I sensed differences, but was not clear on what exactly they were, beyond differences of emphasis: Willard focused more on the Logical Investigations than on Ideas 1, emphasized epistemology more than my teachers did, and was less enthusiastic about the noema.

            "Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that raises many questions in philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science. It is also an area of technological innovation that has completely transformed some aspects of human life and continues to do so. Several broad projects are pursued within AI, depending on whether one is using AI systems to model human psychology or to describe idealized rationality, and depending on whether the focus is on the behavior of a model or also on its internal structure. There are many successful approaches to AI, including symbolic systems and connectionism, and these approaches often compete to explain the full range of cognitive capabilities. There are also philosophical debates about whether it is possible in principle to build a genuinely intelligent computer system. Whereas many approaches to AI have advocated fairly strict divisions of labor between disciplines …\n",

            "Year: 2024\n",
            "Abstract: An introduction to dynamical systems theory, a detailed mathematical analysis of pairs of Braitenberg vehicles, and a look at how these results apply to the study of physical and biological organisms. Powering the concept of a Braitenberg vehicle, developed in 1984 by the Italian-Austrian cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg, is the idea that simple systems can produce complex behaviors. A pair of interacting Braitenberg vehicles is simple, but they can meander, wind around, and follow each another in a number of ways. In this book, Scott Hotton and Jeff Yoshimi show how dynamical systems theory—in particular the theory of open dynamic systems—can be used to analyze pairs of these vehicles in great detail. The result of the authors’ long-standing collaboration at the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, cognitive science, and biology, The Open Dynamics of Braitenberg Vehicles offers a rigorous mathematical foundation for embodied cognition, especially when it comes to two-way interactions between an agent and its environment. Following an introduction to dynamical systems theory, and the most detailed mathematical analysis of Braitenberg vehicles to date, Hotton and Yoshimi discuss how their results can be applied to the study of physical and biological systems. They also describe their work's relevance to debates in the philosophy of embodied cognitive science. Combining the best features of embodied and representational approaches to cognitive science, complete with code and simulations, The Open Dynamics of Braitenberg Vehicles provides an extremely accessible and visually rich look into the workings and applications of …\n",

            "Year: 2023\n",
            "Abstract: Mouse tracking is an important source of data in cognitive science. Most contemporary mouse tracking studies use binary-choice tasks and analyze the curvature or velocity of an individual mouse movement during an experimental trial as participants select from one of the two options. However, there are many types of mouse tracking data available beyond what is produced in a binary-choice task, including naturalistic data from web users. In order to utilize these data, cognitive scientists need tools that are robust to the lack of trial-by-trial structure in most normal computer tasks. We use singular value decomposition (SVD) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to analyze whole time series of unstructured mouse movement data. We also introduce a new technique for describing two-dimensional mouse traces as complex-valued time series, which allows SVD and DFA to be applied in a straightforward way …\n",

            "Abstract: Progress in psychology and the cognitive sciences is often taken to vindicate physicalism and cast doubt on such extravagant metaphysical theses as dualism and idealism. The goal of this paper is to argue that cognitive science has no such implications—rather, evidence from cognitive science is largely (but not wholly) irrelevant to the mind-body problem. Our argument begins with the observation that data from cognitive science can be modeled by supervenience relations. We then show that supervenience relations are neutral, by showing how they can be coherently interpreted in physicalist, idealist, and dualist terms. We distinguish several types of supervenience relation, and show that each coheres better with some positions on the mind-body problem than the other. Since these variants of supervenience are not empirically equivalent, there is a possibility that data from cognitive science will end up …\n",

Husserl and his successors spoke at length about the relationship between phenomenology and the psychology of their day. In the 1950s phenomenological approaches to psychology and social science were established. Phenomenology was not a major source of influence on psychology in the middle of the 20th century. Behaviorism had taken root in academic psychology, and consciousness was officially verboten among serious psychologists. However, phenomenological investigation did persist in various forms, even within psychology. Naturalized phenomenology in its contemporary sense emerged in the late 1990s, in two distinct but complimentary ways. A first group of theorists explicitly drew on the phenomenological …\n",

            "Year: 2015\n",
            "Abstract: Emoticons in informal text communication are common worldwide. They have the potential to reveal emotion and social functions, analogous to facial expression and body gestures in face-to-face verbal communication. Our findings from a corpus study of online text communication by a group of scientists, some of whom were bilingual and others monolingual, suggested that patterns of emoticon use depend on a variety of factors, including emoticon valence and language of texting (Aragon et al., 2014). In the present study we bring these effects into the laboratory by examining the interrelation of emoticons and words in lexical decision (LD) experiments with sequential (SOA 200 ms) but spatially superimposed emoticon-word pairs. Monolingual speakers showed a reliable interaction of emoticon valence with lexicality but interactions with word valence were unreliable. Results will be compared to those from comparable word-word pairs.\n",

            "Abstract: The phrase “neural network” has several meanings. A biological neural network is an actual set of interconnected neurons in an animal brain. Figure 1 shows a biological neural network. However,“neural network” as we will use the phrase means “artificial neural network,” that is, a computer model that has certain things in common with biological neural networks. In particular, artificial neural networks contain simple processing units or “nodes”, that are similar to neurons in the brain, and are connected by “weights”, which are similar to synaptic connections in the brain. Neural networks can be made to do many fascinating things, and have become a core tool in contemporary cognitive science. In this chapter I give a general introduction to neural networks, and survey some of the different ways they are used. After considering uses of neural networks in biology and engineering, I focus on cognitive science. The course as a whole is on neural networks in cognitive science. 1\n",

            "Abstract: This is an open access book which explores phenomenology as both an exceptionally diverse movement in philosophy as well as an active research method that crosses disciplinary boundaries. The volume brings together lively overviews of major areas and schools of phenomenology, as well as the most recent applications across a range of fields. The first part reviews the state-of-the-art in various areas of contemporary phenomenology, including several distinct schools of Husserl and Heidegger scholarship, as well as approaches derived from Merleau-Ponty, de Beauvoir, Fanon, and others. An innovative quantitative analysis of citation networks provides rich visualizations of the field as a whole. The second part showcases phenomenology as a living discipline that can advance research in other areas. While some areas of interaction between phenomenology and other disciplines are by now well established (e.g. cognitive science), this volume sheds light on newer areas of application. The goal is to move beyond discussions of philosophical method and highlight scholars who are actually doing phenomenology in a variety of areas, including: Embodiment and questions of gender, race, and identity, The arts (visual art, literature, architecture), and Archaeology and anthropology. This volume offers a concise introduction to cutting edge phenomenological research and is suitable for both students and specialists.\n",

            "Abstract: Analogical comparison has been found to promote learning across many conceptual domains. Here, we ask whether this mechanism can facilitate children’s understanding of others’ mental states. In Experiment 1, children carried out comparisons between characters’ thoughts and reality and between characters with true beliefs vs. those with false beliefs. Children given this training improved from pre-to post-test. In Experiment 2, we used a more minimal comparison technique. Children saw a series of three stories involving true or false beliefs. There were two betweensubjects conditions that either facilitated (High Alignability) or impeded (Low Alignability) comparison across stories. We found that children made more gains from pre-to post-test in the High Alignability condition than in the Low Alignability condition. We also found effects of production of mental state verbs, as assessed in an Elicitation Task. These results provide evidence for the role of analogical comparison in theory of mind development.\n",

Husserl describes how we experience other conscious beings, and our tacit understanding of how their mental states relate to their bodily states. He also gives an eidetic analysis of these experiences, considering what is necessary and what is left open in our experience of mental states in relation to bodily states—what might be called a “phenomenology of the mind-body problem.”\n",

This trend has increased in the last few decades, and it is now common for phenomenologists to draw on psychology, neuroscience, and other cognitive sciences. What is now called ‘naturalized phenomenology’ dates to the 1990s, when Francisco Varela published “Neurophenomenology: A Methodological Remedy for the Hard Problem” , and a multi-authored volume entitled Naturalized Phenomenology appeared ( et al. 1999). In the late 1990s, the journal Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences was launched and has been active to the present day. Today, ‘naturalized phenomenology’ is a standard phrase, occurring in over 200 journal articles and book chapters to date, and the primary subject of several subsequent anthologies (, ) and special issues of …\n",

In the first half of the paper I give a detailed analysis of this tension, showing how those Husserlian doctrines which seem to speak against application of mathematics to phenomenology do not in fact do so. In the second half of the paper I focus on a particular example of Husserl's “mathematized phenomenology”: his use of concepts from what is today called dynamical systems theory.\n",

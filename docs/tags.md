# HAL tags

Some of the `tags` I add to `person.md` files.

I try to avoid putting any company or organization tags since those are already listed with wikilinks `## Organizations` section of the `person.md` file.

I do add tags for special projects we worked on together, to be able to search on the crews I was part of through my career.

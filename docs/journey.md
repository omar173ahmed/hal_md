# The Long and Winding Road

A bit of context on how I got here. More of the story in the post [Goodbye social networks, hello Markdown](https://medium.com/@noteapps/goodbye-social-networks-hello-markdown-9c504a36d618). 

## 2001

I worked as an Engineering Manager at a startup full of Linux folks and they created a home-grown recruitment system using flat files for interview notes and folders containing resumes. This stuck in my head for a long time, such a simple solution with permissions controlled by Linux file system and Web auth.

## 2002

I came up with the idea to visualize and manage our social networks like we do with computer networks. This lead me to find and learn about social network science.  

## 2003

With some friends we started a company to build out my vision. We failed to get funding and it fizzled away.

## 2007

After my failed social networking software startup. I started developing a tool for myself based on the same concept and nicknamed it HAL. It was built with PHP, MySQL, and Javascript and I continued tweaking it over the years while sipping in my network data.

## 2021

I started a new [hobby](https://www.noteapps.ca/why/) looking for the best Android note-taking app. I tested apps and posted one review a week. As of Dec 2023 I've posted 108 app reviews. Early on one of my [key requirements](https://www.noteapps.ca/my-note-app-l/) was the ability to use Markdown support for input and output. At this point I use [Drafting](https://www.noteapps.ca/drafting/) for quick capture and [Obsidian](https://www.noteapps.ca/obsidian-v1-0-5-scores-7-10/) for pretty much everything. 

## 2022

After two decades of building and using HAL, I got the idea to start using Markdown and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage my social network and wrote a post [Keeping track of people and connections in Obsidian](https://medium.com/@noteapps/keeping-track-of-people-and-connections-in-obsidian-cfd6339b50c) describing the idea.

## 2023

I spent a lot of time writing an exporter for my large ego network of 3,640 people from my custom MySQL DB to Markdown. I stopped using HAL as my main tool and now only use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It's slow to load on Android (about 30 seconds) but fast once loaded. On Windows, loads in about 9 seconds. 37,638 files.
